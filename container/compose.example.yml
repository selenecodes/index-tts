    # Available commands:
    # - webui: Launches the IndexTTS WebUI.
    # - gpu-check: A diagnostic tool to detect available hardware accelerators.

    #   run `docker attach indextts` in another terminal.
    # - update: Updates the application to the latest version of the code via Git.
    # - your own command: You can even run your own custom commands or scripts,
    #   such as `uv run your_app.py`.
    #
    # NOTE: You can also run alternative commands without editing these defaults,
    # by executing `docker compose run --service-ports indextts <command>`.
